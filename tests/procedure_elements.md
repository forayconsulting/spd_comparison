## Notes for AI Extraction

1. **Not all plans will have provisions for every element** - use "Not specified" when information is absent
2. **Maintain consistent terminology** across all plans even if plans use different terms
3. **Distinguish between**:
   - "Not specified in documents provided" (information may exist elsewhere)
   - "Explicitly states not required" (plan affirmatively says something isn't required)
   - "Unclear from document" (ambiguous language)
4. **Prioritize critical elements** that materially affect participant rights (timeframes, arbitration, finality)
5. **Group related elements** in outputs for better readability
6. **Use the exact procedure element names** from this list in output JSON for consistency
