What should I be concerned about with this analysis?

Based on the analysis of the provided documents, there are several significant areas of concern regarding the financial stability of specific funds, potential gaps in coverage, and the complexity of eligibility rules.

Here are the primary concerns you should have regarding this analysis:

1. Critical Funding Status and Benefit Reductions (Northwest Plan)
The UNITE HERE Northwest Pension Trust Fund shows the most significant signs of financial distress among the four plans.

The Concern: According to the "Rehabilitation / Funding Status" row in the Comparison Table, the plan was declared in "Critical Status" in 2012 and adopted a Rehabilitation Plan in 2013.
Impact: This resulted in the creation of "Default" and "Preferred" schedules which mandated contribution increases but offered no benefit accrual on those additional contributions (see "Benefit Accrual / Formula" row). Furthermore, the plan eliminated the 36-month payment guarantee for the normal benefit option and eliminated disability benefits for those over age 55 (see "Disability Pension Eligibility" row).
Risk: Participants in this plan face reduced ancillary benefits and stricter rules compared to the other plans.
2. Variable Benefit Accruals Based on Market Performance (Sacramento Plan)
The Sacramento Independent Hotel, Restaurant and Tavern Employees Pension Plan ties the future accumulation of benefits directly to the plan's financial health.

The Concern: According to the "Benefit Accrual / Formula" row for Sacramento, the accrual rate fluctuates based on the "Funded Percentage."
Impact: If the plan is 100% funded, participants earn 1.60% of contributions. However, if the funded percentage drops below 80%, the accrual rate plummets to 0.50%.
Risk: Participants cannot predict their future retirement income with certainty, as a market downturn could drastically reduce the value of their labor in future years.
3. Lack of Disability Coverage (Sacramento Plan)
The Concern: The Sacramento Plan explicitly states it does not provide a Disability Benefit (see "Disability Pension Eligibility" row).
Impact: Unlike the Southern Nevada, San Francisco, and (to a lesser extent) Northwest plans, a participant in Sacramento who becomes totally disabled before retirement age has no immediate pension safety net and must wait until Early Retirement age (55) to collect, likely at a reduced rate.
4. High-Stakes "Window" Deadlines (San Francisco Plan)
The San Francisco Plan relies heavily on "Window" benefits to provide higher payout rates.

The Concern: As noted in the "Special 'Window' Benefits" row, the $50/year Window VII benefit requires retiring between April 2019 and April 2023 (or 2025 for specific employers).
Impact: A participant who misses this window (e.g., retires one month too late or terminates employment outside the window) reverts to the standard, significantly lower benefit rate ($25.00 or $18.80 per year of service vs. $50.00).
Risk: This creates a "cliff" where poor timing in retirement planning results in a permanent, substantial loss of income.
5. Document Age and Missing Restatements (Northwest Plan)
The Concern: The core SPD for the UNITE HERE Northwest Plan is dated June 2005 (see "General Domain and Structure").
Impact: While SMMs (Summaries of Material Modifications) up to 2018 are provided, relying on a base document that is nearly 20 years old is risky. Significant federal legislation (such as the Pension Protection Act of 2006) has passed since the SPD was written.
Risk: There may be administrative changes or legal updates not fully captured in the provided SMMs that would be present in a fully restated Plan Document.
6. Complexity of Merged Plans
The Concern: Both the Northwest and San Francisco plans involve mergers with other union plans (e.g., the "Oakland Plan" for SF).
Impact: As noted in the "Early Retirement Eligibility" row for San Francisco, the Oakland Plan has different early retirement reduction factors and eligibility ages (55 vs 62).
Risk: The "General" rules summarized in the analysis usually apply to current active participants. Participants with service credit from prior to a merger (e.g., pre-2012 for Oakland/SF) may be subject to entirely different vesting and calculation rules that are often less generous than the current plan.
