What should I be concerned about with this analysis?

Based on the analysis of the provided documents, there are several significant areas of concern regarding benefit security, legal rights, and eligibility "traps." Because these are multi-employer plans governed by different collective bargaining agreements, the rules vary drastically between regions.

Here are the specific concerns you should be aware of, categorized by the type of risk:

1. Plan Solvency and Variable Benefit Accruals (Financial Risk)
The most significant financial concern appears in the Northwest and San Diego plans, where benefit accumulation is directly tied to the financial health of the specific trust fund.

UNITE HERE Northwest (Seattle): As noted in the "Recent/Specific Modifications" row, this plan entered "Critical Status" in 2013 and adopted a Rehabilitation Plan.
Concern: Under the "Default Schedule," employers pay massive surcharges (up to 88% increases), but surcharges do not accrue benefits for the participant. Additionally, the accrual rate dropped from ~3.3% (pre-2009) to just 1.0% of contributions (post-2010) (See "Benefit Calculation Method" row). This represents a severe reduction in the value of future work.
San Diego: As noted in the "Benefit Calculation Method" row, the accrual rate is variable based on the plan's PPA Market Value Funded Percentage.
Concern: If the plan's funding drops below 80%, your benefit accrual drops to 0.50% of contributions. If it is over 100%, it is 1.60%. This transfers investment risk directly to the participant; a bad market year could slash the value of your labor for that year by more than two-thirds.
2. The "Window" Benefit Trap (San Francisco)
The San Francisco plan relies heavily on "Window" benefits (e.g., Window VII, Special Window VI) to provide meaningful pension rates (e.g., $50/year vs. the standard $18.80–$25.00).

Concern: As detailed in the "Benefit Calculation Method" row, these benefits have strict "retire by" deadlines (e.g., April 1, 2023, or April 1, 2025). If a participant misses a window deadline or terminates employment outside of the specific dates, their benefit could drop by 50% or more (from ~$50 per credit year down to ~$25 or lower). This requires extremely precise retirement planning.
3. Limitation of Legal Rights (San Diego)
There is a major disparity in legal recourse between the plans.

Concern: According to the "Mandatory Arbitration" row, the San Diego plan mandates arbitration as the exclusive remedy and includes a Class Action Waiver.
Contrast: The San Francisco and Sacramento plans preserve your right to file a civil action under ERISA Section 502(a) after exhausting appeals. In San Diego, you effectively waive your right to sue in federal court or join a class action if the plan is mismanaged.
4. Lack of Disability Coverage (Sacramento)
While most plans provide a disability pension if you become totally disabled before retirement age, Sacramento does not.

Concern: As stated in the "Disability Pension Eligibility" row, the Sacramento plan explicitly states: "This Plan does not provide a Disability Benefit." If a participant in Sacramento becomes disabled at age 50 and cannot work, they cannot access pension funds until they reach Early Retirement age (62), creating a potential 12-year income gap.
5. High Vesting Thresholds (Northwest)
Vesting rules determine whether you keep your benefits if you leave the industry.

Concern: According to the "Vesting Requirements" row, the Northwest plan requires 1,000 hours to earn a full vesting service year. In contrast, Southern Nevada and San Diego generally require only 300 hours to avoid a break in service or earn a participation year. A part-time worker in Seattle is much more likely to suffer a break in service and lose benefits than a worker with identical hours in Las Vegas.
6. "Cliff" Reduction Factors for Early Retirement
If you plan to retire before Normal Retirement Age (usually 65), the penalty varies significantly.

Concern: In Southern Nevada (See "Early Retirement Reduction Factors" row), retiring between 55 and 60 incurs an additional 0.50% reduction on top of the standard reduction.
Contrast: San Francisco uses a standard 0.60% reduction, and Sacramento uses 0.50%. The specific math of the reduction factor can make retiring at 55 viable in one plan but financially ruinous in another.
Summary Checklist for Action
Check your plan's funding status: If you are in San Diego or Northwest, check the Annual Funding Notice immediately to see if your accrual rate is in danger of dropping.
Verify your hours: If you are in Seattle (Northwest), ensure you are hitting the higher 1,000-hour threshold to vest.
Check "Window" dates: If you are in San Francisco, do not resign without verifying you are inside a "Window" period.
Review Dispute Resolution: If you are in San Diego, be aware that you cannot sue the plan in court.
