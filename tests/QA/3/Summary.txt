**Relationships and Structure**
The documents function as a hierarchy: the SPDs provide the foundational rules, while the SMMs/Notices amend specific sections based on economic conditions (e.g., 2008 recession recovery), legislative changes (e.g., PPA of 2006, COVID-19 relief), or collective bargaining negotiations. All documents follow a similar legal structure mandated by ERISA but differ in specific benefit multipliers, vesting schedules, and regional administration details.
