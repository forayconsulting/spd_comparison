What should I be concerned about with this analysis?
Assistant
Based on the analysis of these five pension plans, there are several significant areas of concern. These plans operate independently, meaning a rule or safety net in one city does not apply to another. The most critical risks involve plan underfunding measures (Rehabilitation Plans), complex eligibility "windows," and gaps in coverage such as disability benefits.

Here are the specific concerns you should have based on the documents:

1. Financial Health and "Critical Status" (Seattle & San Diego)
The Concern: Some plans have triggered "Critical Status" under ERISA, forcing them to adopt "Rehabilitation Plans." This legally allows trustees to reduce benefits that were previously promised (adjustable benefits) and increase employer costs without increasing your payout.
Where it applies:
Seattle (Northwest): The 2013 Rehabilitation Plan notice is aggressive. It eliminated the disability benefit for those over 55, removed the 36-month payment guarantee, and significantly increased the reduction penalties for retiring early (e.g., retiring at 60 formerly gave you 90% of your benefit; under the new rules, it drops to 60%). Furthermore, employer "surcharges" paid to fix the fund do not count toward increasing your benefit amount.
San Diego: Your future benefit accrual rate is not fixed. It fluctuates based on the plan's "Funded Percentage." If the plan is healthy (100% funded), you earn 1.60% of contributions. If the plan struggles (below 80% funded), your earning rate drops to 0.50%. This transfers market risk directly to you.
2. "Window" Benefit Complexity (San Francisco)
The Concern: San Francisco utilizes a highly complex system of "Window" benefits (e.g., Window VI, Window VII). The difference in monthly payments between a "Window" benefit and a "Regular" benefit is drastic (e.g., $50 per credit year vs. $18.80 per credit year).
The Risk: Eligibility for these higher rates depends on retiring within specific date ranges and working for specific "Level" employers. If you miss a window deadline, terminate employment too early, or work for an employer who didn't agree to the higher contribution rate, your lifetime monthly benefit could be less than half of what your coworker receives for the same years of work.
3. Missing Disability Benefits (Sacramento)
The Concern: Most pension plans act as a safety net if you become disabled before retirement age.
Where it applies: Sacramento explicitly states, "This Plan does not provide a Disability Benefit." If you work in Sacramento and become disabled before age 62, you generally cannot access your pension early without penalty, whereas other plans (like Las Vegas or San Francisco) would allow you to retire early with a full or calculated benefit.
4. Strict "Break in Service" Rules
The Concern: In the hospitality industry, employment can be sporadic. All five plans have "Break in Service" rules where, if you work fewer than a specific number of hours (usually 300 or 500) in a year, you incur a break.
The Risk: If you are not yet "Vested" (usually requiring 5 years of service) and you have consecutive breaks equal to your years of service, you permanently lose all accrued credits.
COVID-19 Impact:
Las Vegas and San Diego explicitly amended their plans to grant free service credit or restore hours during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent participants from losing their pensions.
Sacramento, Seattle, and San Francisco documents provided (or the specific SMMs available) do not explicitly detail automatic hour restoration for pension credits (though Sacramento extended claims deadlines). If you had a gap in work during 2020-2021 in these regions, you must verify if you incurred a break in service.
5. Reciprocity and Moving Between Jurisdiction
The Concern: These are five separate trust funds. Working 3 years in San Diego and 3 years in Las Vegas does not automatically vest you in either plan (since both require 5 years).
The Solution/Risk: You must rely on "Reciprocity" or "Pro Rata" agreements. You must proactively ensure the funds communicate with each other. If you fail to notify the funds that you have moved, you may lose credits in your original fund due to the "Break in Service" rules mentioned above.
6. Early Retirement Penalties
The Concern: Retiring before Normal Retirement Age (usually 65) results in a permanent reduction of your monthly check.
Comparison:
Las Vegas: Retiring at 60 results in a moderate reduction.
Seattle: Under the Rehabilitation Plan, retiring at 60 results in a massive 40% reduction of your monthly check.
San Diego & Sacramento: Standard reduction of roughly 0.5% per month.
Takeaway: You must check the specific reduction table for your city; assuming they are all the same could cost you thousands of dollars over your retirement.
Summary of Action Items
Check your Vesting Status: Ensure you have at least 5 years of service to lock in your benefit.
Verify COVID Credits: If you didn't work in 2020/2021, confirm with your specific plan administrator if you incurred a Break in Service.
Review "Window" Status (SF Only): If in San Francisco, verify if your current employer is a "Window VII" employer and know the expiration date of that window (April 1, 2023, or 2025).
Request a Benefit Estimate: Do not rely on general calculations. Request a written estimate from the fund administrator that accounts for your specific work history and any Rehabilitation Plan reductions.
