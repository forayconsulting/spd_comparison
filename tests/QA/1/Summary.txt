SPD Comparison Summary

The provided documents constitute the Summary Plan Descriptions (SPDs), Plan Documents, and Statements of Material Modifications (SMMs) for five distinct multiemployer defined benefit pension plans covering hospitality workers in the Western United States. Collectively, these plans fall under the domain of Taft-Hartley trust funds, managed jointly by employer and union (UNITE HERE) trustees, and governed by ERISA regulations.

**Relationships and Common Structure**
While each plan operates independently with unique benefit multipliers and eligibility rules, they share a structural framework. Each document defines "Covered Employment," outlines vesting schedules (typically 5 or 10 years), establishes rules for "Breaks in Service," and details payment options (e.g., Joint and Survivor Annuities). They all serve to inform union members how collectively bargained employer contributions convert into lifetime retirement income.
