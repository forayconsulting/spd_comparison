# SPD Comparison Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Client:** Western Pension Fund  
**Project Type:** Proof of Concept

## Business Objective

Compare Summary Plan Descriptions (SPDs) across multiple plan units to identify differences and facilitate standardization following a merger. The client needs to reduce multiple approaches (e.g., "three different ways of handling appeals across five plan units") down to a single standardized approach.

## Success Criteria

1. **Usefulness:** Deliver actionable comparison results that identify key differences between plans
2. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Demonstrate superior value compared to law firm junior associates at $500/hour
3. **Time Tracking:** Document all time spent to prove cost-effectiveness

## Budget

- **Target Budget:** $3,000 - $4,000
- **Benchmark:** Must deliver more value than 8 hours of attorney time
- **Technology Costs:** Minimal (sub-$1 to $1.25 per analysis run)

## Input Documents

- **Quantity:** 10 PDF files (SPDs from before merger)
- **Note:** SMMs (Summary of Material Modifications) exist but are not included in initial scope

## Primary Use Case: Claims and Appeals Comparison

### Required Analysis

Compare "claims and appeals" sections across all plan documents. This includes:

1. **Claims Procedures**
   - Procedure elements
   - Plan-by-plan comparison

2. **Appeals Procedures**  
   - Appeals details
   - Procedure elements
   - Plan-by-plan comparison

### Key Differences to Identify

Examples of the types of differences that must be surfaced:
- Arbitration requirements (mandatory vs. voluntary)
- Class action waivers
- Any procedural variations across plans

### Challenges

- Section titles may vary across documents
- Relevant language may be "referenced in multiple places within the document"
- Must account for inconsistent naming and organization

## Deliverable Format

**Output:** Comparison table/matrix showing:
- Each plan unit
- Specific policy areas (claims procedures, appeals procedures, arbitration, etc.)
- Side-by-side differences
- Clear identification of where plans diverge

**Format Preference:** CSV or similar structured format for easy review

## Expansion Considerations

While not required for proof of concept, the client has indicated potential interest in:
- Expanding analysis to "a couple dozen" Unite Here plans (if documents available)
- Comparing additional sections beyond claims and appeals
- Interactive chatbot interface for querying comparison results

## Validation Requirements

The client must be able to:
1. Quickly identify where standardization is needed
2. Make informed decisions about which approaches to keep or merge
3. Understand specific language differences that create policy conflicts

## Notes

- Client is Western Pension Fund/Unite Here organization
- This is a test case to prove viability before larger engagement
- Success could lead to broader SPD comparison/merging work across additional plan units
